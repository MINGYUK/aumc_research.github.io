The Ajou University Medical Research Forum is a weekly gathering hosted by the Ajou University Medical Research Society. The society is comprised of translational medicine researchers, primarily M.D.-Ph.D. holders, who are alumni of the Ajou University School of Medicine. Our members specialize in areas including Biochemistry, Clinical Oncology, Neurology, Brain Science Bioinformatics, and Medical Informatics. We pursue a broad range of translational medical research, with a primary focus on integrating in vitro/in vivo transcriptomics with real-world medical data.

This forum spans a wide array of articles published across multidisciplinary fields, enhancing collaboration and innovation in medical research. We conduct weekly reviews of up-to-date articles from renowned journals such as Nature, Cell, Science, and the New England Journal of Medicine. We always welcome new members or attendees who are eager to continuously explore the unknown world with us!
