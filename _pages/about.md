The Ajou University Medical Research Forum is a weekly gathering hosted by the Ajou University Medical Research Society. This society is comprised of translational medicine researchers, primarily M.D.-Ph.D. holders, who are alumni of the Ajou University School of Medicine.

This forum spans a wide array of multidisciplinary fields, enhancing collaboration and innovation in medical research. Our members specialize in areas including Biochemistry, Clinical Oncology, Neurology, Bioinformatics, and Medical Informatics. We pursue a broad range of translational medical research, with a primary focus on integrating in vitro/in vivo transcriptomics with real-world medical data.
